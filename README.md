üìö Library Management System
A console-based Python application that simulates a simple library management system. It allows users to borrow, return, and search for books, while also enabling library administrators to add and manage book records. The system also includes a rating system to gauge user satisfaction.

üéØ Features
Add Books: Add new books to the library collection with multiple copies.
Borrow and Return Books: Users can borrow available books and return them later.
Book Search: Search for books by title, author, or both.
Track Borrowed Books: Keep track of users' borrowed books, including due dates.
User and Book Management: Easily add, remove, and manage users and books.
Service Rating System: After returning the last borrowed book, users can rate the library service.
Average Rating: Display the library‚Äôs average rating based on user feedback.
Next Availability: If a book is not available, the system tells users when it will be available based on the borrowing period of others.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python 3.x: The project is built using Python.
OOP: Object-Oriented Programming principles for managing books and users.
Data Structures: Efficient searching and management using binary search, lists, and tuples.
